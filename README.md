# angr-crackmes

This repo will be used to document my attempts at learning more about using angr through solving crackmes from crackmes.one

The goal here is to solve the crackmes manually then attempt to use angr to arrive at the correct solution. I know literally *nothing* about angr so this will certainly take some time, and almost certainly be of no use to anyone.
